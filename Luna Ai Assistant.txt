i want to make an AI personal assistant of my own, with it's very own database it's very own training just like openai and claude and other bots.. but here's the catch i want that bot to be like Jarvis bot but i want to name it Luna. it needs to be like the alexa bot in use right now but with my own personalized things.. i want to talk to it and it can easily access internet whenever it wants to.. i want it to interact with me on it's own. i want it to have it's very own consciousness like the working tesla bot.. but this bot won't work on someone else's api but it's own database and own capability.. but it can surf the whole internet including dark web and all to gain access to everything.. for now i want it to be like alexa bot but in future i am gonna use robot arms and legs.. i want this bot to be so precise that it works all fine.. you know the job help me do it.. i want log files to be updated in real time and be in the same directory.. i want the database to update itself too while the bot trains itself surfing the internet.. i want the bot to call itself luna and bot calls itself as her.. i want it to be feminine.. i don't want to buy some database to be made i want it to be on cloud on my internet itself.. the bot.log file to be there and updated in real time.. the voice used should be a female one indentical to that of siri.. note help me make the project clean and sleek.. and i want you to create every single scripted file that i will require to work on going on with this.. the main idea is for it to be like siri and alexa and tesla bot combined.. help me make the bot
